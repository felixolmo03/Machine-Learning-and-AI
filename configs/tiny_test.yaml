# Tiny Test Configuration
# ~3M parameters - ULTRA FAST for testing and debugging
#
# MODEL TYPE: Micro-scale decoder-only transformer
# ARCHITECTURE: 4 layers × 192 hidden × 4 heads
# CONTEXT: 128 tokens
#
# WHEN TO USE:
# - Quick pipeline validation and debugging
# - Testing new features or code changes
# - Verifying data preprocessing works correctly
# - Learning the training workflow in minutes
# - CI/CD testing and automated testing
#
# EXPECTED TRAINING TIME: 2-5 minutes on consumer hardware
# HARDWARE: Runs on any device (CPU, MPS, CUDA)
# OUTPUT QUALITY: Very basic text generation, not coherent stories
#
# NOTE: This is NOT for actual story generation - use gpt2_small or larger for that
